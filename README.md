# stupidtree
A generic tree implementation in Python.


## Installation

From pypi:

```bash
pip install stupidtree
```

or clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luozhouyang/stupidtree
```

## Architecture

The design of this lib is flexible and expandable.

The module `stupidtree.core` has already defines the `Node` class, which works for most situations.  
Here is the `__init__` function's signature:

```python
def __init__(data, tag, parent):
    pass
```

For your special needs, you can inherit the `Node` class and override some functions as your need.

This module also defines the `BaseTree` class, which is the base class of all trees. It has already implemented the
interface `BaseTreeInterface`. This interface(or abstract class) contains these useful methods:

```python
import abc


class BaseTreeInterface(abc.ABC):

    def put(self, words):
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def remove(self, key, rm_filter):
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def get(self, key):
        raise NotImplementedError()
```  

**You can put nodes into the tree with any depth and any counts**.

For improving searching performance, a `Indexer` has been implemented. It is based on `dict`, using `hash` of keys to search nodes in O(1).    

Module `stupidtree.core` has implemented a tree `IndexedTree` that supports index. In most situations, the index will be helpful. And if you 
want to add another index, just inherit `NodeIndexInterface` and implements the abstract methods.

## Usage
The usage of `stupidtree` is quitely simple. You just need to put a string or a list into a constructed tree that derived from `BaseTree` or `IndexedTree`.  
Here is a example of Chinese address in `stupidtree.examples` package.  

For intuitive, I am showing you a few test examples:  

```python
import unittest

from stupidtree.examples.address.level import Level
from stupidtree.examples.address.pcd_tree import PCDTree


class TestPCDTree(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_put(self):
        tree = PCDTree()
        a0 = '浙江省 杭州市 西湖区'
        tree.put(a0)
        self.assertEqual(4, tree.size())
        tree.print()
        a1 = '浙江省 杭州市 江干区'
        tree.put(a1)
        self.assertEqual(5, tree.size())

        nodes = tree.get('浙江省')
        self.assertEqual(1, len(nodes))
        for n in nodes:
            self.assertEqual(Level.PROVINCE, n.tag)

    def test_remove(self):
        tree = PCDTree()
        a0 = '浙江省 杭州市 西湖区'
        tree.put(a0)
        a1 = '浙江省 杭州市 江干区'
        tree.put(a1)
        tree.print()

        tree.remove('江干区')
        self.assertEqual(4, tree.size())
        tree.print()

        tree.remove('浙江省')
        self.assertEqual(1, tree.size())
        tree.print()

        tree.remove('')
        print()
        tree.print()
        self.assertEqual(0, tree.size())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```  


And here are the outputs:

```bash
+--
|    +--浙江省
|    |    +--杭州市
|    |    |    +--西湖区
.+--
|    +--浙江省
|    |    +--杭州市
|    |    |    +--西湖区
|    |    |    +--江干区
+--
|    +--浙江省
|    |    +--杭州市
|    |    |    +--西湖区
|    |    |    +--江干区
+--
|    +--浙江省
|    |    +--杭州市
|    |    |    +--西湖区
|    |    |    +--江干区

+--
|    +--浙江省
|    |    +--杭州市
|    |    |    +--西湖区
|    |    |    +--江干区
```
